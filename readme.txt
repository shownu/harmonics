## data conversion and consolidation

s0_json_to_csv.py OR octave_json_to_csv.py TO CONVERT JSON TO CSV. FOLLOW UP WITH post-conversion macro
get_max_values.py TO GET MAX LEVEL FOR EACH TIME/BEAM COMBO
extract_harmonics.py TO EXTRACT HARMONICS FROM CSV RESULTING FROM GET MAX
consolidate_harmonics.py TO SHOW TRUE HARMONICS EVERY x TIME PERIODS
find_peaks.py TO MONITOR EMITTER BEHAVIOUR

## visualisation using R

by-date.R SHOWS ALL FREQUENCIES IN A CHOSEN BEAM OVER TIME
colour-split.R FOR A SPECIFIED TIME POINT, SHOWS VARIATION IN LEVEL BY BEAM, COLOUR-CODED BY FREQUENCY
freq-colours.R BLACK BACKGROUND PLOT OF FREQUENCIES OVER TIME - RECOMMENDED USE WITH EXTRACTED HARMONICS DATA BUT CAN BE USED WITH MAX VALUES - JUST TAKES A LONG TIME TO LOAD
find-few.R FIND FREQUENCIES OF INTEREST
hms.R CONVERTS SECONDS TO HH:MM:SS - NOT ALWAYS USEFUL...
nice-plot.R 3D PLOT WITH OPTION TO SELECT BEAMS OR TIMES. ARCHIVE
show-harmonics.R FREQS OVER TIME WITH ABLINE SHOWING MOST COMMON HARMONICS
